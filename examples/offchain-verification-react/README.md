# Offchain Verification Example (React + TypeScript)

This example demonstrates how to integrate **ZK Passport** offchain verification into a React application using **TypeScript**.
It showcases the offchain proof generation and verification flow â€” without requiring a deployed smart contract.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- Yarn >= 1.22

## Installation

From the project root:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies from the `monorepo root`:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then build the packages from the `monorepo root`:

```bash
yarn build
```

Navigate to the example folder:

```bash
cd examples/offchain-verification-react
```

Install local dependencies (to make sure you use the latest built packages from dist/):

```bash
yarn install
```

## Start the App

```bash
yarn start
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173 by default.
